# Native iOS Nabto Edge Thermostat control app

AppMyProduct/Nabto starter app for iOS based on the heat control scenario. See the [Ionic
version](https://github.com/nabto/ionic-starter-nabto) for more details on the app and
[www.appmyproduct.com](https://www.appmyproduct.com) for more information about the concept in general.

## Installation

The app uses the NabtoClient Cocoapod, so to build and run, perform the following steps:

1. Install dependencies: `$ pod install` (see https://www.cocoapods.org for info on installation of the pod tool)

2. Open the generated workspace in XCode and work from there: `open NabtoEdgeThermostat.xcworkspace`

If you see odd errors from Cocoapods, try upgrading to a reasonably new version (problems observed with 1.0.x, while 1.2.0 works fine).
